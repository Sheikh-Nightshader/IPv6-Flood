 IPv6 floods are a type of attack that send a large number of malicious packets to a network or device, overwhelming it with traffic. This can lead to network congestion, service disruption, and resource exhaustion. 
 
 IPv6 flooding attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in network infrastructure or exhaust network resources like bandwidth or CPU. Some examples of IPv6 flooding attacks include ICMPv6, NDP, or UDP floods.
 
 YOU NEED IPv6 enabled on your network in order to run this tool!!
